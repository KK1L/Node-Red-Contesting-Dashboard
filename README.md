A basic multi screen N1MM contesting dasbhoard written in Node Red.

## About

This program is written in Node Red and displays a basic dashboard for real time contesting stats.  N1MM radio, score and contact UDP packets are sent from each N1MM contesting computer to the Node Red server where that information is parsed out and displayed in real time for other contesters to follow.  This dashboard is useful in a multi radio setup with multiple operators keeping up with the contest or Field Day where other operators are wanting to follow along.

## Screenshots

Here are some basic screenshots of the different tabs within the dashboard.
