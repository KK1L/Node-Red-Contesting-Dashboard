Node Red Contesting Dashboard
==============

A basic multi screen contesting dasbhoard written in Node Red.  It currently can display stats from N1MM and TR4W contesting software with more to come!!!

## About

This program is written in Node Red and displays a real time dashboard for ham radio contesting events.  N1MM radio, score and contact UDP broadcast packets are sent from each N1MM contesting computer to the Node Red server.  That information is parsed out and displayed in real time for other contesters to follow.  This dashboard is useful in a multi/1, multi/2, multi-multi radio setup.  It allows operators to keep with the contest during the event.  This program is also useful during Field Day where other operators or guests can follow along in the progress.





## Screenshots

Here are some basic screenshots of the different tabs within the dashboard.
