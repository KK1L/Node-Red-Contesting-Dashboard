Install Readme

## Raspberry Pi OS Install

You can install Node Red on almost any Raspberry Pi, including a Pi Zero.  For instructions on how to build a Rasbperry Pi,
there are tons of YouTube videos out there on how to build.  I created a primer on the Node Red for Ham Radio Groups IO page
That you can use along with a video on after you image your Pi.
